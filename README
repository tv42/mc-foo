MC Foo
======

MC Foo is an advanced, adaptive and learning mp3 jukebox server.

   -continuous music playing
   -learns what music you like and dislike (not finished yet)
   -no static playlists; uses a playqueue you can view and alter
   -can be controlled from any hosts and even with 
    infrared remote controllers (needs more clients)
   -allows multiple user/preference profiles,
    according to whose listening and his or her mood (not finished yet)

Note that MC Foo is in the early stages of development, and not
everything works yet. I use it every day, but your mileage may vary.

MC Foo is distributed under the GNU General Public License.


How to get started
------------------

After installing, the mc-foo data dirs are writable by group mcfoo.
Make your user id be a member of this group (gpasswd -a userid mcfoo,
re-login or newgrp mcfoo to activate). This gives you seamless write
access to the song database.

To import your mp3 collection for use in MC Foo:

mc-foo import file ~/mp3
# insert CD 1
mount /cdrom
mc-foo import file /cdrom my-music-volume1
umount /cdrom
# insert CD 2
mount /cdrom
mc-foo import file /cdrom my-music-volume2

The first form is for permanent, non-removable medias. The latter ones
are for removable medias; the same path can contain multiple alternate
medias. Later you can switch between the two discs by running 

mc-foo change-media file /cdrom my-music-volumeN

To start and stop the music:

mc-foo dj
(yes, it does not daemonize, and spews a lot of debug output. Yes, you
 have to control-c it to make it exit)

mc-foo pause
mc-foo continue

To control the queue:

mc-foo next
mc-foo queue-del
(use arrows, space and enter)


Environment variables
---------------------
                Default value
MCFOOHOME       /usr/lib/mc-foo
MCFOODATA       /var/lib/mc-foo
MCFOOCACHE      /var/cache/mc-foo

MCFOOHOST       0 (localhost)
MCFOOPORT       25706 ('d'<<8+'j')
        - these tell the location of the dj server, for
          mc-foo next, mc-foo queue-del etc.
          Note that dj itself does not currently honor
          the port env.var.


Known problems
--------------

Sometimes mpg123 complains about /dev/dsp and doesn't play the song. 
This is a heisenbug that seems to go away when straced, so finding the
cause is quite hard.

mc-foo next causes both the previous and next song to to play for a
short while. This is caused by buffering in Esound.

The profile system is not operational yet; the profiles are taken into
consideration when the playqueue is filled, but there is no easy way of
inputting your preferences.

The TCP server "list"-command shows bogus values for the informational
fields. They will be replaced with the song attributes (ID3 etc) and
profile information. They are there to demonstrate the protocol
format.
