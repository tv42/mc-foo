MC Foo
======

MC Foo is an advanced, adaptive and learning Ogg/MP3 jukebox server.

   -continuous music playing
   -learns what music you like and dislike (not finished yet)
   -no static playlists; uses a playqueue you can view and alter
   -can be controlled from any hosts and even with 
    infrared remote controllers (needs more clients)
   -allows multiple user/preference profiles,
    according to whose listening and his or her mood (not finished yet)

Note that MC Foo is in the early stages of development, and not
everything works yet. I use it every day, but your mileage may vary.

How to get started
------------------

Using Mc Foo is currently a two step process:

1. Create a tap file

A tap file is a persistent description of a Twisted server. To create
a tap file for Mc Foo, run "mktap dj /path", where "/path" is a
directory tree containing .ogg and .mp3 files. You can also list
multiple directories. It will create a file named "dj.tap".

2. Start a server using the tap file

Servers are actually started with the program "twistd". To start a
server stored in the file "dj.tap", with logging to stdout and
no daemonization, run "twistd -l- -n -f dj.tap".

You can now stop the server by pressing Control-C. When stopped, the
server will write its current state into the file "dj-shutdown.tap". 
You can use this file, instead of "dj.tap", the next time you
start Mc Foo. This will allow you to keep the same playlist from one
run to another.


Controlling the server
----------------------

Run "mc-foo" to get a brief usage message. In general, you give
commands to mc-foo by just typing them as the first argument on the
command line. Anything after the command name is taken to be extra
options or arguments for the command.

To stop and continue the music:

"mc-foo pause"
"mc-foo continue"

To list and control the queue:

"mc-foo list"
"mc-foo next"
"mc-foo fan" (a Tkinter GUI will start up)


Environment variables
---------------------
                Default value
MCFOOHOST       localhost
MCFOOPORT       25706 ('d'<<8+'j')
        - these tell the location of the dj server for
	  the client programs, or the port to listen to,
	  for "mktap dj".


Known problems
--------------

The profile system is not fully functional yet; interacting with it is
currently very tedious.
