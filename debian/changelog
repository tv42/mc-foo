mc-foo (0.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * If opening /dev/sound/mixer fails, /dev/mixer is tried.
  * Volume control now controls PCM volume, not the master
    volume.
  * Changed the package to be architecture-independent, there
    are no C parts left here.
  * Added Build-Depends-Indep: python2.1-dev (Closes: #127796).
  * After creating the install directory, chmod it 0755 to make
    sure building in a sgid dir creates a valid DEBIAN dir
    (Closes: #127799).

mc-foo (0.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Nearly a complete rewrite, using Twisted.
  * There is no automation to clean up after older
    versions when upgrading;
    run "rm -rf /var/cache/mc-foo /var/lib/mc-foo"
    and "groupdel mcfoo"

mc-foo (0.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * It took me three days to learn Python and rewrite most of MC Foo in
    it. I'm happy. From 3300 lines of C to 600 lines of Python. And no
    segfaults.
