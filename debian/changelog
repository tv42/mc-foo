  * Correct the path to plugins.tml (Closes: #165990).

    (Closes: #129175).

mc-foo (0.0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleanups and fixes to make it work better with python2.2 
    and newer twisted.
  * Be mad, not hip; switched the mp3 decoder.
  * Save a dj-snapshot.tap every 60 seconds.

mc-foo (0.0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Python 2.2 is now default (Closes: #161559).

mc-foo (0.0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * New command "mc-foo grep" to search the songs.
  * Pretty-print "mc-foo getscores" output.
  * Bugfix, missing argument made "mc-foo next" fail.

 -- Tommi Virtanen <tv@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Jul 2002 15:27:00 +0300

mc-foo (0.0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * New command "mc-foo pauseorplay" toggles playback.
  * New commands "mc-foo dislike", "mc-foo hate" to say you
    don't like a song.
  * New commands "mc-foo {get,set}{read,write}profile" to say
    what profiles are active and what profiles are in learning
    mode.  
  * New command "mc-foo getscores" dumps the profile as a python
    dict. No "mc-foo setscores" yet.
  * New command "mc-foo mousecontrol" (only if you have CVS Twisted),
    allowing you to control dj with a mouse. Note, this is _raw_ mouse
    protocol for MouseMan mice only, no support from X or GPM required
    so you can use it even when your X session is locked, just plug an
    old mouse into a serial port.
  * Command "mc-foo next" now takes --dislike or --hate flag to also mark
    song as disliked.
  * Fixes a timer-related bug where song playback just would not pause.

mc-foo (0.0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer use mpg321, python-hip is a python lib to decode mp3s.
    The turntable subprocess is gone, it's all in one process now.
  * No longer use ao, it couldn't provide the non-blocking interface I
    want. Aiming for a pure-python solution, currently have to hardcode
    a few ioctl(2) values.
  * For songs where the decoding library can provide timing information
    and seeking (oggs), the tap file now remembers the exact location
    in the song.
  * "mc-foo addqueue" now takes multiple song names, priority
    is now an optional flag.
  * Twisted API changes, reactors etc.
  * Twisted packaging changes, now depend on python2.1-twisted.
  * Some minor bugfixes.

 -- Tommi Virtanen <tv@debian.org>  Fri, 21 Jun 2002 11:57:01 +0300

mc-foo (0.0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * New-style twisted.spread.pb calls.
  * Use a Twisted plugin for tap creation.
  * Install the README file in the package (Closes: #129173).
  * Remove the postrm, it's obsolete (Closes: #128557).

 -- Tommi Virtanen <tv@debian.org>  Fri, 12 Apr 2002 19:55:00 +0300

mc-foo (0.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * If opening /dev/sound/mixer fails, /dev/mixer is tried.
  * Volume control now controls PCM volume, not the master
    volume.
  * Changed the package to be architecture-independent, there
    are no C parts left here.
  * Added Build-Depends-Indep: python2.1-dev (Closes: #127796).
  * After creating the install directory, chmod it 0755 to make
    sure building in a sgid dir creates a valid DEBIAN dir
    (Closes: #127799).

 -- Tommi Virtanen <tv@debian.org>  Fri,  4 Jan 2002 22:14:01 +0200

mc-foo (0.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Nearly a complete rewrite, using Twisted.
  * There is no automation to clean up after older
    versions when upgrading;
    run "rm -rf /var/cache/mc-foo /var/lib/mc-foo"
    and "groupdel mcfoo"

 -- Tommi Virtanen <tv@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Dec 2001 20:22:23 +0200

mc-foo (0.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * It took me three days to learn Python and rewrite most of MC Foo in
    it. I'm happy. From 3300 lines of C to 600 lines of Python. And no
    segfaults.
